                <p class="post_content">But I must explain to you how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" 
                    target="_blank">chooses to enjoy</a> all this mistaken idea of 
                    denouncingpleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you 
                    a complete account of the system <a href="mailto:tony@email.com">contact</a>, 
                    and expound the actual teachings of the 
                    great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.
                    No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is
                    pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
                    rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
                    Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to 
                    obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally 
                    circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great 
                    pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes 
                    laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? 
                    But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a 
                    pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain 
                    that produces no resultant pleasure?"
